The solution focuses on calculating the maximum power of the signal patterns by extracting the power from the simulations and then summing the weighted power along the frequency axis. The solution addresses the issue of highly skewed values due to the large number of templates and frequencies by employing several normalization techniques. The solution uses a sinc kernel to collect the signal and recompute the power sum with this kernel around the largest-power line.
